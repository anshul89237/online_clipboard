📋 What is Online Clipboard?
Online Clipboard is a simple and secure tool that lets you transfer text or images between devices using a unique token.

💡 How It Works
Type or paste the content you'd like to share into the input box above.
Click Send to Online Clipboard. A unique token will be generated.
Enter that token in the "Retrieve Clipboard" section below to view your content.
🌐 Why Use It?
Unlike traditional clipboards that work only on one device, Online Clipboard bridges the gap between all your devices. No login, no file uploads—just fast, private clipboard sharing with a short token.

🔄 Future Plans
We plan to add support for rich-text formatting, image previews, and secure auto-expiry of clips. Feedback is always welcome as we improve your experience!
